# Runtime Data (`agent/data/`)

This folder stores runtime learning artifacts generated by the backend.

## Files

- `agent_events.jsonl`
  - append-only JSON Lines event log
  - event types include:
    - `scan`
    - `act`

## Why it exists

- enables transparent mission replay,
- powers `/insights` analytics,
- helps identify recurring failures and performance bottlenecks,
- supports autonomous system improvement recommendations.

## Operational guidance

- Keep file out of source control if it grows rapidly (runtime artifact).
- Rotate periodically in production workloads.
- Preserve samples for post-incident analysis and demo evidence.
